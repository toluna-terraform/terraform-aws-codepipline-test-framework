# newman-reporter-junitfull
JUnit reporter for [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) that provides the information about the collection run in JUnit format.
This needs to be used in [conjunction with Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#external-reporters) so that it can recognize JUnit reporting options.

> JUnit Reporter based on [XSD](https://github.com/windyroad/JUnit-Schema/blob/master/JUnit.xsd) specified by [Publish Test Results task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/test/publish-test-results?view=vsts&tabs=yaml) for Azure Pipeline | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015

> Different from [newman-reporter-junit](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/lib/reporters/junit/index.js) is using executions to have full report and no aggregated report.
Please use [newman-reporter-junit](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/lib/reporters/junit/index.js) if you want the original aggregated results.

## Install
> The installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Replace -g from the command below with -S for a local installation)

```console
$ npm install -g newman-reporter-junitfull
```

## Usage
The examples provided in the usage are for showing the differences between [newman-reporter-junit](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/lib/reporters/junit/index.js) and this project.

Iteration (```-n 2```) is used to show the difference between original and full reports.

JUnit examples can be found [here](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag/newman-reporter-junitfull/tree/master/examples).

### Original
> Use [newman-reporter-junit](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/lib/reporters/junit/index.js) to execute.

In order to enable this reporter, specify `junit` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r junit --reporter-junit-export './examples/original/result.xml' -n 2
```

### Full

In order to enable this reporter, specify `junitfull` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r junitfull --reporter-junitfull-export './examples/full/result.xml' -n 2
```

### Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-junitfull-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output XML file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |

#### With Newman as a Library
The CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    reporters: 'junitfull',
    reporter: {
        junitfull: {
            export: './examples/full/result.xml', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
        }
    },
	iterationCount: 2
}, function (err) {
	if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

## Compatibility

| **newman-reporter-junitfull** | **newman** | **node** |
|:-----------------------------:|:----------:|:--------:|
|            v1.0.0             | >= v4.0.0  | >= v6.x  |
|            v1.1.0             | >= v4.0.0  | >= v6.x  |

## Troubleshooting

### Reporter not found
The reporter and newman must be installed at the same level, the installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise.

### Getting different JUnit output
You are most probably getting in-built reporter output used in older versions of newman, Please check the newman's [compatibility](#compatibility) section above.
